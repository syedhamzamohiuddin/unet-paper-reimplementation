# unet-paper-reimplementation
Faithful implementation of the original U-Net architecture with weight maps, elastic deformation, and full training pipeline — based on the 2015 paper.

# 🧠 U-Net Paper Reimplementation — From Scratch and Faithful to the Original

This project is a deep, from-scratch reimplementation of the original **U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation** paper (Ronneberger et al., 2015).  
The implementation is divided into beginner-friendly Kaggle notebooks, each dedicated to a core component of the original architecture and training setup — **no shortcuts, no black boxes**.

> 📌 This repository serves as a landing page to the full notebook series and highlights what makes this implementation faithful to the original work.
